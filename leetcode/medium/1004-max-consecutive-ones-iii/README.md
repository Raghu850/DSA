![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return  *the maximum number of consecutive* `1` *'s in the array if you can flip at most*  `k` `0`'s.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
- 0 <= k <= nums.length

        res=0
        c=0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r]==0:
                c+=1
            while c>k:
                if nums[l]==0:
                    c-=1
                l+=1
            res=max(res,r-l+1)
        return res
```
