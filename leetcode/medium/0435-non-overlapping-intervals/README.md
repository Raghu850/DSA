# Non-overlapping Intervals

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return  *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

 **Note**  that intervals which only touch at a point are  **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 105
- intervals[i].length == 2
- -5  *104 <= starti < endi <= 5*  104

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0

        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        prev_end = intervals[0][1]

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if prev_end > intervals[i][0]:
                res += 1
            else:
                prev_end = intervals[i][1]
        
        return res
```
