# Rotting Oranges

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is  **4-directionally adjacent**  to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return  *the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange*. If  *this is impossible, return*  `-1`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
