# Reverse Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return  *the reversed list*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

 

 **Follow up:**  A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        node = None

        while head:
            temp = head.next
            head.next = node
            node = head
            head = temp
        
        return node
```
