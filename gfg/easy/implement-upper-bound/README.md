# Implement Upper Bound

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a  **sorted** array  **arr[]** and a number  **target**, the task is to find the  **upper**  bound of the  **target**  in this given array.
The  **upper bound**  of a number is defined as the smallest  **index**  in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.

 **Note:**  If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the  **target**, the upper bound will be the length of the array.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[6] = 25) is larger than 11.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100
Output: 7
Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater than 100, return the length of array.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ target ≤ 106

```py
class Solution:
    def upperBound(self, arr, target):
        # code here
        l,h=0,len(arr)-1
        while l<=h:
            mid=(l+h)//2
            if arr[mid]<=target:
                l=mid+1
            else:
                h=mid-1
        return l
```
